chandra_aca.planets.get_earth_boresight_angle
=============================================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.planets.get_earth_boresight_angle(start, stop)

   
   Calculate Earth boresight angle from Chandra.

   The boresight angle is the angle from the ACA boresight to the Earth limb or center.
   This assumes that the Earth is spherical with radius 6371 km. The Earth position
   relative to Chandra is interpolated from cheta's ``orbitephem0``.

   The opening angle is the angle from the Earth center to limb as viewed from Chandra.

   :Parameters:

       **start** : CxoTime-compatible
           Start time

       **stop** : CxoTime-compatible
           Stop time



   :Returns:

       EarthBoresightAngles
           Dataclass with attributes:
           
           - times (CxoTime)
           - earth_limb_angle (deg)
           - earth_open_angle (deg)
           - earth_center_angle (deg)

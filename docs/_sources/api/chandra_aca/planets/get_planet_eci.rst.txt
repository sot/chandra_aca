chandra_aca.planets.get_planet_eci
==================================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.planets.get_planet_eci(body, time = None, pos_observer = None)

   
   Get ECI apparent position for solar system ``body`` at ``time``.

   This uses the built-in JPL ephemeris file DE432s and jplephem. The position
   is computed at the supplied ``time`` minus the light-travel time from the
   observer to ``body`` to generate the apparent position on Earth at ``time``.

   ``body`` and ``pos_observer`` must be one of "sun", "mercury", "venus",
   "earth-moon-barycenter", "earth", "moon", "mars", "jupiter", "saturn", "uranus",
   "neptune", or "pluto".

   Estimated accuracy of planet coordinates (RA, Dec) is as follows, where the
   JPL Horizons positions are used as the "truth". This assumes the observer
   position is Earth (default).

   - Venus: < 12 arcmin with peak around 2 arcmin
   - Mars: < 8 arcmin with peak around 1.5 arcmin
   - Jupiter: < 1 arcmin with peak around 0.5 arcmin
   - Saturn: < 0.5 arcmin with peak around 0.3 arcmin

   :Parameters:

       **body** : str
           Body name (lower case planet name)

       **time** : CxoTimeLike, optional
           Time or times for returned position (default=NOW)

       **pos_observer** : str, optional
           Observer position (default=Earth)



   :Returns:

       ndarray (float)
           Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) position (km) as (x, y, z)
           or N x (x, y, z)

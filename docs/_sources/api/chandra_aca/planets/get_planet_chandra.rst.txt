chandra_aca.planets.get_planet_chandra
======================================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.planets.get_planet_chandra(body, time = None, ephem_source = 'cxc')

   
   Get position for solar system ``body`` at ``time`` relative to Chandra.

   This uses the built-in JPL ephemeris file DE432s and jplephem for the planet
   position relative to Earth center, along with the predictive Chandra orbital
   ephemeris from either the OFLS (default) or STK. The ``body`` position is computed
   at the supplied ``time`` minus the light travel time from Earth to ``body`` to
   generate the apparent position from Chandra at ``time``. Note that light travel time
   from Chandra to Earth (up to 0.5 seconds) is ignored.

   Estimated accuracy of planet coordinates (RA, Dec) from Chandra is as
   follows when using cheta predictive ephemeris, where the JPL Horizons
   positions are used as the "truth".

   - Venus: < 0.25 arcsec with a peak around 0.02
   - Mars: < 0.45 arcsec with a peak around 0.1
   - Jupiter: < 0.2 arcsec with a peak around 0.1
   - Saturn: < 0.2 arcsec with a peak around 0.1

   :Parameters:

       **body** : str
           Body name

       **time** : CxoTimeLike
           Time or times for returned position (default=NOW)

       **ephem_source** : str
           Source of Chandra ephemeris: 'cxc' (default) or 'stk':
           
           - 'cxc': ``orbitephem0_*`` MSIDs from the OFLS in the cheta CXC telemetry archive.
           - 'stk': ``orbitephem_stk_*`` computed MSIDs from STK predictions on OCCweb.



   :Returns:

       ndarray (float)
           Position relative to Chandra (km) as (x, y, z) or N x (x, y, z)

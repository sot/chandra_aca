chandra_aca.planets.get_planet_chandra
======================================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.planets.get_planet_chandra(body, time = None)

   
   Get position for solar system ``body`` at ``time`` relative to Chandra.

   This uses the built-in JPL ephemeris file DE432s and jplephem, along with
   the CXC predictive Chandra orbital ephemeris (from the OFLS). The position
   is computed at the supplied ``time`` minus the light-travel time from
   Chandra to ``body`` to generate the apparent position from Chandra at
   ``time``.

   Estimated accuracy of planet coordinates (RA, Dec) from Chandra is as
   follows, where the JPL Horizons positions are used as the "truth".

   - Venus: < 0.25 arcsec with a peak around 0.02
   - Mars: < 0.45 arcsec with a peak around 0.1
   - Jupiter: < 0.2 arcsec with a peak around 0.1
   - Saturn: < 0.2 arcsec with a peak around 0.1

   :Parameters:

       **body** : str
           Body name

       **time** : CxoTimeLike
           Time or times for returned position (default=NOW)



   :Returns:

       ndarray (float)
           Position relative to Chandra (km) as (x, y, z) or N x (x, y, z)

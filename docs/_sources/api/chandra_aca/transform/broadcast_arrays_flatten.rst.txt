chandra_aca.transform.broadcast_arrays_flatten
==============================================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.transform.broadcast_arrays_flatten(*args)

   
   Broadcast ``*args`` inputs to same shape and flatten.

   Broadcast ``*args`` inputs to same shape.and then return that shape and the
   flattened view of all the inputs.  This lets intermediate code work on all
   scalars or all arrays that are the same-length 1-d array and then reshape
   the output at the end (if necessary).

   :param args: tuple of scalar / array inputs
   :returns: [shape, \*flat_args]

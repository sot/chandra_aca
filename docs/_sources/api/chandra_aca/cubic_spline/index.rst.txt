chandra_aca.cubic_spline
========================

.. py:module:: chandra_aca.cubic_spline

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Provides CubicSpline class for Ska2 environment that has an older
   scipy package.  This was added in scipy 0.18 and can be removed
   if/when scipy is upgraded or transition to Ska3 is completed.
   Note that the scipy upgrade wants to bring numpy along for the ride.

   The CubicSpline class here is just copied from the scipy package,

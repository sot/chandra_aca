chandra_aca.drift.get_fid_offset
================================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.drift.get_fid_offset(time, t_ccd, drift_pars = None)

   
   Compute the fid light offset values for a given time and temperature.

   The ``time`` and ``t_ccd`` inputs can be either scalars or arrays.

   :Parameters:

       **time** : CxoTimeLike format
           Time for offset calculation.

       **t_ccd** : float
           ACA CCD temperature in degrees Celsius.

       **drift_pars** : dict, optional
           ACA drift model parameters.  If not supplied, the default parameters are used.



   :Returns:

       tuple
           A tuple containing the y-angle and z-angle offsets (in arcseconds) to apply
           additively to the nominal (FEB07) fid positions.








   .. rubric:: Notes

   The apparent fid light positions change in accordance with the ACA alignment drift as a
   function of time and temperature. This is captured in the ACA aimpoint drift model. This
   function uses that model to provide the offsets in y-angle and z-angle (arcsec) to apply
   additively to the nominal fid positions.

   The y_offset and z_offset values in this function were calibrated using the
   2022-11 aimpoint drift model and the FEB07 fid characteristics.

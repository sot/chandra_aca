chandra_aca.broadcast_arrays
============================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.broadcast_arrays(*args)

   
   Broadcast ``*args`` inputs to same shape.

   Broadcast ``*args`` inputs to same shape and return an ``is_scalar`` flag and
   the broadcasted version of inputs.  This lets intermediate code work on
   arrays that are guaranteed to be the same shape and at least a 1-d array,
   but reshape the output at the end.

   :param args: tuple of scalar / array inputs
   :returns: [is_scalar, \*flat_args]

chandra_aca.attitude.calc_roll_pitch_yaw
========================================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.attitude.calc_roll_pitch_yaw(yag, zag, yag_obs, zag_obs, sigma=None)

   
   Calc S/C delta roll, pitch, and yaw for observed star positions relative to reference.

   This function computes a S/C delta roll/pitch/yaw that transforms the
   reference star positions yag/zag into the observed positions
   yag_obs/zag_obs.  The units for these values must be in arcsec.

   The ``yag`` and ``zag`` values correspond to the reference star catalog
   positions.  These must be a 1-d list or array of length M (number of
   stars).

   The ``yag_obs`` and ``zag_obs`` values must be either a 1-d or 2-d array
   with shape M (single readout of M stars) or shape N x M (N rows of M
   stars).

   The ``sigma`` parameter can be None or a 1-d array of length M.

   The algorithm is a simple but fast linear least-squared solution which uses
   a small angle assumption to linearize the rotation matrix from
   [[cos(th) -sin(th)], [sin(th), cos(th)]] to [[1, -th], [th, 1]].
   In practice anything below 1.0 degree is fine.

   :Parameters:

       **yag**
           reference yag (list or array, arcsec)

       **zag**
           reference zag (list or array, arcsec)

       **yag_obs**
           observed yag (list or array, arcsec)

       **zag_obs**
           observed zag (list or array, arcsec)

       **sigma**
           centroid uncertainties (None or list or array, arcsec)



   :Returns:

       roll, pitch, yaw (degrees)

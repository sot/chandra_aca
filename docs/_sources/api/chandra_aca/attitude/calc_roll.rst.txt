chandra_aca.attitude.calc_roll
==============================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.attitude.calc_roll(yag, zag, yag_obs, zag_obs, sigma=None)

   
   Calc S/C delta roll for observed star positions relative to reference.

   This function computes a S/C delta roll that transforms the reference star
   positions yag/zag into the observed positions yag_obs/zag_obs.  The units
   for these values can be anything (arcsec, deg) but must all be consistent.

   The inputs are assumed to be a list or array that corresponds to a single
   readout of at least two stars.

   The algorithm is a simple but fast linear least-squared solution which uses
   a small angle assumption to linearize the rotation matrix from
   [[cos(th) -sin(th)], [sin(th), cos(th)]] to [[1, -th], [th, 1]].
   In practice anything below 1.0 degree is fine.

   If there are different measurement uncertainties for the different
   star inputs then one can supply an array of sigma values corresponding
   to each star.

   :Parameters:

       **yag**
           reference yag (list or array)

       **zag**
           reference zag (list or array)

       **yag_obs**
           observed yag (list or array)

       **zag_obs**
           observed zag (list or array)



   :Returns:

       roll (deg)

chandra_aca.star_probs.prob_n_acq
=================================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.star_probs.prob_n_acq(star_probs)

   
   Get probability of acquiring n_acq stars.

   Given an input array of star acquisition probabilities ``star_probs``,
   return the probabilities of acquiring exactly n_acq stars, where n_acq
   is evaluated at values 0 to n_stars.  This is returned as an array
   of length n_stars.  In addition the cumulative sum, which represents
   the probability of acquiring n_acq or fewer stars, is returned.

   :Parameters:

       **star_probs** : array of star acq probabilities (list or ndarray)
           :returns n_acq_probs, cum_n_acq_probs: tuple of ndarray, ndarray

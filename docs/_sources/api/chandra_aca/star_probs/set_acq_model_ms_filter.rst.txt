chandra_aca.star_probs.set_acq_model_ms_filter
==============================================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.star_probs.set_acq_model_ms_filter(ms_enabled=False)

   
   Set acq model multiple star filter.

   This chooses one of two sets of acquisition model fit parameters based
   on ``ms_enabled``.  The default is ``False``:

   - True: MS filtering enabled (prior to FEB0816 loads), where stars would
     be rejected if MS flag was set
   - False: MS filtering disabled (including and after FEB0816 loads)

   The selected fit parameters are global/module-wide.

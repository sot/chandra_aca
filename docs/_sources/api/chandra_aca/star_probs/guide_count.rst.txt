chandra_aca.star_probs.guide_count
==================================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.star_probs.guide_count(mags, t_ccd, count_9th=False)

   
   Calculate guide star fractional count.

   Calculate a guide star fractional count/metric using signal-to-noise scaled
   mag thresholds.

   This uses a modification of the guide star fractional counts that were
   suggested at the 7-Mar-2018 SSAWG and agreed upon at the 21-Mar-2018
   SSAWG.  The implementation here does a piecewise linear interpolation
   between the reference mag - fractional count points instead of the
   original "threshold interpolation" (nearest neighbor mag <= reference
   mag).  Approved at 16-Jan-2019 SSAWG.

   One feature is the slight incline in the guide_count curve from 1.0005 at
   mag=6.0 to 1.0 at mag=10.0.  This does not show up in standard outputs
   of guide_counts to two decimal places (``8 * 0.0005 = 0.004``), but helps with
   minimization.

   :Parameters:

       **mags** : float, array
           Star magnitude(s)

       **t_ccd** : float, array
           CCD temperature(s)

       **count_9th** : bool
           Return fractional count of 9th mag or brighter stars



   :Returns:

       float, fractional count

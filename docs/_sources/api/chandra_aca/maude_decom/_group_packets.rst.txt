chandra_aca.maude_decom._group_packets
======================================

.. py:function:: chandra_aca.maude_decom._group_packets(packets, discard=True)

   
   Group ACA image telemetry packets to form full images.

   ACA telemetry is packed in packets of 225 bytes, and each of these is split in four VCDU frames.
   Each ACA telemetry packet includes pixel telemetry for 16 pixels in each of the 8 slots.
   A 4x4 image is complete in one packet, whereas 6x6 and 8x8 images are split into two and four
   packets respectively.

   This function takes a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing the pixel
   telemetry for one slot in a VCDU frame. Each dictionary must have the keys 'MJF', 'MNF'
   and 'IMGTYPE'. It returns a list of lists of dicts, where each list of dicts contains the pixel
   telemetry for a full image.

   The function assumes:
   - all entries correspond to the same slot
   - the entries are ordered by increasing VCDU counter
   - missing/repeated VCDU counters have been removed

   If this is not the case, the results will be incorrect.

   :Parameters:

       **packets**
           list of ACA sub-packets

       **discard**
           bool to discard incomplete ACA packets



   :Returns:

       list of ACA packets
